# Tech Journal

A central hub for organizing and finding technical notes, and to track personal growth; thus, serving as a reference to easily recall where I acquired specific facts or insights.

This repository is where I transcribe my thoughts and knowledge from various resources, references, and media into Obsidian Markdown.
