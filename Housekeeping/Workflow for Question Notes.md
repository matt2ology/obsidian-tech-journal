# Workflow for Question Notes

## Create Questions

- Ask specific, open-ended, and challenging questions during learning.
- Focus on questions that will deepen understanding rather than ones with
  immediate answers.

## Revisit Regularly

Periodically review unanswered questions and try to resolve
them through research or reflection.

## Answer and Expand

Once you answer a question, either:

- Update the relevant Permanent Note
- Link the answer to the Question Note for reference

## Turn Answers into Notes

If a question leads to a new insight, create a **new Atomic Note**
or update a **Permanent Note**.
