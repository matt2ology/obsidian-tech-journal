# Obsidian Structure and Workflow

## Structure and Workflow

This process ensures a balance between **active learning** (Feynman Technique), **structured synthesis** (Permanent Notes), and **practical application** (Practice Notes), creating a self-reinforcing system for knowledge management.

### Folder Structure

1. **Reference Notes:** Store raw material captured from various sources
2. **Literature Notes:** Contain your interpretations and insights from reference notes
3. **Permanent Notes:** Atomic, standalone ideas written in simple and clear language
4. **Content Creation:** Aggregate permanent notes to create content for external sharing
5. **Housekeeking/Templates:** Store reusable note templates
6. **Resources:** Include guides, templates, or other reference material related to the workflow

### Note Taking Workflow

1. **Reference Notes:** Direct quotes or highlights from other sources, captured using tools like Readwise or Obsidian. These notes summarize someone else's thoughts and help create literature notes.
2. **Literature Notes:** Personal interpretations of reference notes, written in your own words to express what you gained from the material.
3. **Permanent Notes:** Standalone, concise ideas or concepts, written clearly for an uninformed audience (e.g., Explain Like I'm 5 (ELI5) style). Each note covers only one idea and should be easy to grasp without needing the original context.
4. **Content Creation:** Permanent notes are building blocks for creating larger works, like blog posts, by synthesizing multiple ideas.

### Lifecycle Flow

- Capture → Process → Synthesize → Use → Review/Maintain
  - Each stage builds on the previous one to ensure smooth progression.
  - Regular reviews keep the system aligned with your growth and goals.
- Permanent Notes don't Link to Literature Notes; for, it avoid over-linking, as Permanent Notes are meant to be self-contained
- Literature Notes Link to Other Literature Notes: Literature Notes represent your interpretations, and sometimes one interpretation builds on or relates to another. This linking helps create chains of reasoning or deeper thematic connections between your thoughts.
- Always link from Literature Notes to the Reference Notes that inspired or supported them.
- Question Notes can link to any note type (Reference, Literature, Permanent) depending on where the insights lead.

```

#### Reference Notes Are Important when:

1. **Complex or Dense Material:** For sources with intricate arguments or lots of data, Reference Notes help you organize key details before interpreting them.
2. **Collaborative Context:** If you’re sharing insights or need to cite sources, having detailed Reference Notes ensures accuracy.
3. **External Knowledge Management:** Capturing someone else’s ideas ensures you can revisit the source later for clarification or deeper understanding.

#### Literature Notes Without Reference Notes

##### When You Might Have Literature Notes Without Reference Notes

1. **Direct Engagement:**
   - If you're consuming material (e.g., reading a book, watching a lecture) and writing down insights in your own words as you go, you may skip the formal step of creating Reference Notes.
   - Your initial observations become Literature Notes directly.
2. **Synthesis-First Approach:** If your primary goal is to reflect and extract meaning rather than meticulously document external information, you can create Literature Notes without first summarizing the source.
3. **Pre-digested Content:** If you’re working from something like personal notes or a summary (e.g., a Readwise export or course handout), the material might already be condensed, allowing you to jump straight to Literature Notes.

##### Best Practices if Skipping Reference Notes

- **Provide Context:** In the Literature Note, briefly mention where the idea came from (e.g., "From _Book Title_, Chapter 3 on XYZ").
- **Link Back:** If you later decide a detailed Reference Note is needed, you can retroactively create one.

#### When You Might Have Permanent Notes Without Reference or Literature Notes

##### Best Practices for Permanent Notes Without References or Literature Notes

- **Self-contained Context:** Ensure the Permanent Note is clear, concise, and provides enough context to stand alone.
- **Link to Related Notes:** Connect the Permanent Note to relevant Exploration Notes, Question Notes, or other Permanent Notes to build a network of ideas.
- **Review for Gaps:** Periodically revisit these notes to see if they need further validation or elaboration through external references.

### **Summary of Life Cycles**

| **Stage**           | **Note Type**    | **Purpose**                                        | **Input**                                | **Output**                           | **Next Step**                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Capture**         | Reference Notes  | Record raw information from external sources.      | Source material (books, articles, etc.). | Highlights, quotes, and metadata.    | Process into **Literature Notes**.     |
| **Process**         | Literature Notes | Reflect and interpret in your own words.           | Reference notes.                         | Personal insights in your own words. | Synthesize into **Permanent Notes**.   |
| **Synthesize**      | Permanent Notes  | Create atomic, reusable, and standalone knowledge. | Literature notes (multiple, if needed).  | Concise, context-independent idea.   | Link related notes and use in content. |
| **Use**             | Content Creation | Combine ideas to create valuable content.          | Multiple permanent notes.                | Draft or final version of content.   | Publish or share the content.          |
| **Review/Maintain** | All Notes        | Keep knowledge relevant, accurate, and connected.  | Existing notes.                          | Updated or archived notes.           | Restart workflow or refine further.    |
